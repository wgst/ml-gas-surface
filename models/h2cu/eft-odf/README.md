# Multidimensional model for predicting orbital dependent friction (ODF) for H2Cu molecular dynamics with electronic friction.

### Main model file: "eft_ac.model".

The model can be used to evaluate ODF-type electronic friction tensor in molecular dynamics with electronic friction.

This model was trained with ACEds.jl package (version 0.1.7).
