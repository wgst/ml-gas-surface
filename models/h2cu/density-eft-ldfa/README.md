# Multidimensional model for predicting bare surface electron density model for H2Cu.

### Main model file: "h2cu_ace.json".

The model can be used to evaluate LDFA-type electronic friction tensor in molecular dynamics with electronic friction.

This model was trained with ACEpotentials.jl package (version 0.6.5). Information about depending packages and their versions can be viewed in the model file ("h2cu_ace.json").
